In simple, Spring AOP + AspectJ allow you to intercept method easily.

Common AspectJ annotations :

    @Before – Run before the method execution
    @After – Run after the method returned a result
    @AfterReturning – Run after the method returned a result, intercept the returned result as well.
    @AfterThrowing – Run after the method throws an exception
    @Around – Run around the method execution, combine all three advices above.
    
 Note:::
 
 To enable AspectJ, you need aspectjrt.jar, aspectjweaver.jar and spring-aop.jar. 

Enable AspectJ:In Spring configuration file, put "<aop:aspectj-autoproxy />", and 
define your Aspect (interceptor) and normal bean.
