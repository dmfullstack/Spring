In Spring, you can either implements InitializingBean and DisposableBean interface 
or specify the init-method and destroy-method in bean configuration file 
for the initialization and destruction callback function. 

In this article, we show you how to use annotation @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy
 to do the same thing.
 
Note
The @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy annotation are not belong to Spring, 
it’s located in the J2ee library – common-annotations.jar.
