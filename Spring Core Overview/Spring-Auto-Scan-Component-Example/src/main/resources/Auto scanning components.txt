There are 4 types of auto components scan annotation types

    @Component – Indicates a auto scan component.
    @Repository – Indicates DAO component in the persistence layer.
    @Service – Indicates a Service component in the business layer.
    @Controller – Indicates a controller component in the presentation layer

 So, which one to use? It’s really doesn’t matter. 
 Let see the source code of @Repository,@Service or @Controller.

@Target({ElementType.TYPE})
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Documented
@Component
public @interface Repository {
 
	String value() default "";
 
}

You will noticed that all @Repository,@Service or @Controller are annotated with 
@Component. So, can we use just @Component for all the components for auto scanning? Yes, 

you can, and Spring will auto scan all your components with @Component annotated.

It’s working fine, but not a good practice, for readability, you should always 
declare @Repository,@Service or @Controller for a specified layer to make your code
 more easier to read,
