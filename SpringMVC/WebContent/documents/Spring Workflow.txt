The Client requests for a Resource in the Web Application.
The Spring Front Controller, which is implemented as a Servlet, will intercept the Request and then will try to find out the appropriate Handler Mappings.
The Handle Mappings is used to map a request from the Client to its Controller object by browsing over the various Controllers defined in the Configuration file.
With the help of Handler Adapters, the Dispatcher Servlet will dispatch the Request to the Controller.
The Controller processes the Client Request and returns the Model and the View in the form of ModelAndView object back to the Front Controller.
The Front Controller then tries to resolve the actual View (which may be Jsp, Velocity or Free marker) by consulting the View Resolver object.
Then the selected View is rendered back to the Client.
