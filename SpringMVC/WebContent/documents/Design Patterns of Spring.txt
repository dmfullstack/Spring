Dispatcher Servlet ---> Front Controller Design Pattern

The Dispatcher Servlet as represented by 
org.springframework.web.servlet. DispatcherServlet, 
follows the Front Controller Design Pattern for handling Client Requests. 
It means that whatever Url comes from the Client, 
this Servlet will intercept the Client Request before passing the Request 
Object to the Controller. 
The Web Configuration file should be given definition in such a way that this 
Dispatcher Servlet should be invoked for Client Requests. -
